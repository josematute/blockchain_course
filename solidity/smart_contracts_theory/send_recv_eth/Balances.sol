Receiving Ethereum
This contract tracks the amount of ether received from any address that sends ether to the contract. 
To do this, it implements both a receive and fallback function as well as a getAmountSent function. The
getAmountSent (address addr) : returns the amount of ether in wei that addr has sent to the contract.
